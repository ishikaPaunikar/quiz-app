#DESCRIPTION ABOUT QUIZ-APP
The Indian Quiz App is a fully functional browser-based quiz application designed using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It is a single-page application that provides an interactive and engaging way for users to test their knowledge of India’s history, culture, geography, and general facts. The project focuses on simplicity and functionality without relying on any external libraries or frameworks, making it an excellent example of how essential front-end technologies can be used to create an educational tool.

The structure of the application is defined using HTML5. It contains a main container that holds the quiz interface, including a title, question display, multiple-choice options, feedback messages, a countdown timer, and a final score section. Each part of the interface is dynamically updated using JavaScript, ensuring a seamless user experience throughout the quiz.

CSS3 is used to style the interface, giving it a clean, readable, and user-friendly appearance. The background colors, button designs, font styles, and layout are customized to offer a visually appealing theme that aligns with the Indian context of the quiz. The quiz container is centered on the screen and styled with rounded corners and shadows to enhance its appearance. Buttons change color to indicate correct or incorrect responses, making the interaction intuitive and informative.

JavaScript forms the core logic of the application. A fixed set of 20 multiple-choice questions is stored in an array of objects, with each object containing a question, four options, and the correct answer. When the application loads, the first question is displayed, and a countdown timer of ten seconds begins. Users can select one of the four options, and their selection is immediately evaluated. If the selected option is correct, the button turns green and the user receives a “Correct!” message. If the answer is incorrect, the selected button turns red while the correct answer is highlighted in green, along with a message indicating the correct response.

If the user fails to select an option within the time limit, the application automatically displays the correct answer and disables further interaction with the options. This feature adds a time-based challenge to the quiz, encouraging quick thinking and decision-making. A “Next Question” button appears after each answer, allowing the user to proceed to the next question in the set.

At the end of the quiz, once all 20 questions are answered, the application hides the quiz interface and displays the final score in the format "Quiz Completed! Your score is X/20", summarizing the user’s performance. This final output is presented in a clear and simple format, providing immediate feedback on the user’s knowledge.

Overall, the Indian Quiz App is a lightweight, educational web application that demonstrates practical use of front-end development skills including DOM manipulation, event handling, dynamic content generation, and user feedback mechanisms. It runs entirely in the browser without the need for any server-side technologies or external dependencies, making it easy to deploy on platforms like GitHub Pages. This project can be further expanded by adding features such as difficulty levels, randomized questions, user login, score tracking, and category selection, making it a flexible base for more advanced quiz applications.
